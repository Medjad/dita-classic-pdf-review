# Plugin Showing Oxygen Change Tracking information in the PDF output
Plugin which allows showing Oxygen track changes and comments in the classic PDF output obtained using the DITA OT.
The plugin is compatible with both DITA OT 1.8 and 2.x. 

This plugin does not contribute a new transformation type, it has a single parameter called "show.changes.and.comments" which should be set to "yes" in order to enable showing Oxygen track changes and comments in the generated PDF.

You just need to install it and then run the regular PDF (Idiom) publishing using the PDF plugin bundled with the DITA OT.
